# In this project, I use web scraping techniques to download the Sice-TAC cost data for each month since July 2021. 
# The Sice-TAC system is the reference for the price floor fixation in road freight transport in Colombia. 
# This data can be used to study financial schemes for the adoption of zero-emission technologies.
